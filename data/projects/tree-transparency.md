# Abstract

- We propose a web app deployed on a blockchain platform to address challenges related to tree plantation. The app aims to improve transparency in fund transfers and enable volunteers to track the status of planted trees.

- Using blockchain technology, the app ensures transparent and accountable fund transfers, minimizing the risk of misuse. Volunteers can use the app to regularly update tree growth and health, facilitating timely interventions to prevent drying and death. Real-time data collection helps analyze factors for successful tree growth and enhances survival rates.

- To encourage citizen participation, the app incorporates a rewards system, motivating volunteers to actively monitor and nurture trees.

- In summary, the proposed web app on a blockchain platform improves transparency in fund transfers and enables volunteers to track tree status. Incentivizing citizen involvement enhances tree survival and fosters responsibility towards environmental conservation.

# Methodology

- Design a user-friendly landing page with an authentication system for the app.
- Implement a feature that allows authenticated users to update the status of trees they are monitoring.
- Ensure the accuracy and reliability of tree status updates by leveraging a network of miners for verification.
- Utilize a smart contract to automate and facilitate the timely distribution of rewards to users.
- Incorporate a payment gateway within the web app, enabling organizations to make payments to NGOs and government bodies.
- Streamline financial transactions and promote transparency by integrating the payment gateway functionality.
- Enhance user experience by providing a secure login system and intuitive interface for updating tree statuses.
- Foster trust and accountability by implementing a robust verification process involving a network of miners.
- Optimize efficiency by automating reward distribution through the use of smart contracts.
- Simplify financial transactions and promote transparency by offering a payment gateway for seamless payments to beneficiary entities.
